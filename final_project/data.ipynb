    "The data for my project will come from a variety of sources:\n",

    "## Location data\n",
    "- Foursquare\n",
    "    - For the data on hospitals in each zipcode of each county for New York and Kansas. Unsure yet if I will also collect data on doctor's offices.\n",
    "    - The data will need to be cleaned as sometimes there are multiple entries for each hospital, including separate wards and waiting areas.\n",
    "    - Depending on the radius, some searches may overlap, so I may need to discard duplicates.\n",
    "    - Here is an example of data from foursquare about a doctor's office:\n",

    "- Economic Research Service, US Dept of Agriculture\n",
    "    - They have a listing of all counties in the US, and whether they are classed as 'metropolitan' or 'non-metropolitan' according to the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n",
    "    - I will be using this to determine which counties in New York and Kansas count as urban - metropolitan, or rural - non-metropolitan\n",

    "I can find the zip codes in each county, and then the coordinates for each zip code.\n",
    "I can pass those to Foursquare and get a list of hospitals in those zip codes.\n",
    "Once the data has been cleaned and processed, I will have a count of the number of hospitals per county, and per state.\n",
